# Contributing

**The issue tracker is only for bug reports and enhancement suggestions. If you have a question, please ask it in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/VdaB5NK) instead of opening an issue â€“ you will get redirected there anyway.**

If you wish to contribute to the discord.js codebase or documentation, feel free to fork the repository and submit a
pull request. We use ESLint to enforce a consistent coding style, so having that set up in your editor of choice
is a great boon to your development process.

## Setup

To get ready to work on the codebase, please do the following:

1. Fork & clone the repository, and make sure you're on the **master** branch
2. Run `yarn install`
3. Code your heart out!
4. Run `yarn test` to run ESLint and ensure any JSDoc changes are valid
5. [Submit a pull request](https://github.com/sabinico/among-us-bot/compare) (Make sure you follow the [conventional commit format](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/))
